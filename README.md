A simple, quick game to play with friends or even by yourself! Test your knowledge and typing skills at the same time, and also get bragging rights on beating the game!


## Inspiration

This week, we had a theme allowing us to recreate old games, so I tried to remake my favourite typing+trivia game using technology I had never used before!


## What it does

This prototype has a simple *interface*, an *API* for questions, a *Timer* and a *Score* section. The user clicks the Start button initiating the timer and starting the loop to bring up questions 1 by 1. Answers for the same are displayed on screen and the user can type in their answer and press enter!


## How we built it

This time, I built it using the tech stack I never used before - *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*.
It took a lot of time to learn all these while also finding ways to implement what I wanted. 

- I tried to make my HTML as simple as possible.

- The CSS contains a lot of cheeky stuff, including a *sliding double background gradient*, *opacity* and *visibility* tricks, a *Google API Font*, and for the first time in my experience, the *Grid* Layout. This was the most fun part in this project.

- JavaScript. To be honest, I never liked the language to begin with, but this project made me want to give it a try. Thankfully, it turned out to be good stuff. I set up *Fade In* and *Fade Out* effects, *Score* and *Timer* sections, *HTML Alterations* using *DOM*, *Async API Data fetching* and of course, BUGS.

But in the end, it turned out good enough


## Challenges we ran into

This time, the one major challenge I ran into was the entire concept of JavaScript. Asynchronicity, Data Types, functions interfering with each other, HTML Tag issues, sytax errors and what not.

I had to learn many work-arounds for these problems which, if nothing else, improved my problem solving skills.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- The HTML Structure
- The beautiful, flowing-liquid background
- The timer system
- Fetching data through the API

## What we learned

- JavaScript basics
- Fetching data through APIs
- DOM
- Animated backgrounds
- Asynchronous functions

## What's next for Train Your Brain
- Removing Bugs
- Adding a Login/Sign-up System
